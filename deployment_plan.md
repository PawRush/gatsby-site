## Session Log

### Session 1 - 2025-12-19T09:37:00Z to 10:15:00Z (DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE)
```
Agent: Claude (Haiku 4.5)

COMPLETED:
✅ Phase 1: Frontend Deployment Infrastructure Setup

Activities:
1. Verified deploy-to-aws branch exists (already on correct branch)
2. Installed npm dependencies with --legacy-peer-deps
3. Built Gatsby project successfully (public/ directory created)
4. Created deployment_plan.md and AGENTS.md for tracking
5. Initialized CDK TypeScript project foundation
6. Created lib/stacks/frontend-stack.ts:
   - S3 bucket for website content
   - CloudFront distribution with OAI (Origin Access Identity)
   - Error response handling for SPA routing (403/404 → /index.html)
   - CloudFront security policies (TLS 1.2+, HTTP/2 & HTTP/3)
   - Asset deployment to S3
7. Created infra/bin/infra.ts with:
   - Environment auto-detection (preview-jairosp)
   - Account/region resolution
   - Stack name generation
8. Created scripts/deploy.sh with:
   - Gatsby build support (NODE_OPTIONS for legacy OpenSSL)
   - CDK bootstrap
   - Deployment with context variables
   - Output capture for URL and distribution ID
9. Committed all infrastructure changes to git

Infrastructure Status: ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

Next Steps to Complete Deployment:
1. Execute: cd infra && npm run deploy
   OR: ./scripts/deploy.sh
2. Monitor CloudFormation stack creation
3. Capture outputs: WebsiteURL, BucketName, DistributionId
4. Test website access via CloudFront URL

Notes:
- Gatsby build requires NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider" (legacy Gatsby version)
- CloudFront configured for SPA with auto-routing to index.html
- S3 bucket auto-deletion enabled for preview environments
- Production (environment=prod) retains resources for safety

PHASE 1 DEPLOYMENT EXECUTED AND SUCCESSFUL:
10. Built Gatsby site with NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider"
11. Executed: export NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider" && ./scripts/deploy.sh
12. CDK deployment created all resources successfully:
    - S3 Bucket: gatsbysitefrontend-preview-jairosp-763835214576
    - CloudFront Distribution: E13LJZT96EK968
    - CloudFront URL: https://d1ayimb380n433.cloudfront.net/
13. Verified website is LIVE with HTTP 200 response
14. Updated deployment plan with live URLs and outputs

✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE - WEBSITE LIVE ON AWS

Next: Phase 2 - Documentation (if needed for README updates)

Context Used: ~80% of available tokens
